# ScalaSnap

Runs a game of Snap after asking the user for the number of players, decks and match type to play with.

It doesn't output any of the running of the game, just the index of the winning player.

Winning player is decided by who has the most cards in their hand when the first player runs out of cards.

When there are cards matching on top of the decks, ANY player can be first to win the piles that have their top card matching.

Setup distributes the shuffled deck(s) to all players as evenly as possible.


There are definitely aspects of the code I wanted to work on more. Some functions could do with refactoring, and there is no testing in the codebase.
